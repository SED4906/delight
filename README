Delight (a small reimplementation of part of systemd)

Delight is intended for low-RAM systems.  Development
started because Wii Linux[1] is based on ArchPOWER so
it uses systemd.  The Wii has little RAM available...

"systemd on a machine with like 72 megs of available ram is one of the computing experiences ever"
